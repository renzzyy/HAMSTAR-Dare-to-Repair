# HAMSTAR: Dare to Repair - v. 1.0

HOW TO PLAY

The game opens with a main menu, where the user can either choose to start playing the game, open an options menu, or exit to the desktop. The options menu allows the player to toggle on/off fullscreen mode, adjust the volume of the game, adjust graphics quality, and view a list of game controls. For convenience, the controls are:

MOVE - [A] and [D]

JUMP - [Space]

CROUCH - [Left Ctrl]

INTERACT - [E]

PAUSE - [ESC]


The pause menu allows the player to either resume playing, go to an options menu (where they can change volume, toggle fullscreen mode, and view a controls list), or return to the main menu.

After the player selects the "Play" button, a brief "cutscene" will play, explaining the storyline of the game. If the player wishes to watch it, they can wait for it to end and the first level will automatically start. However, if the player doesn't wish to watch the entire thing, they may press down on the space bar to skip the cutscene at any point.

Use the A and D keys to move left or right, the space bar to jump, and Left Ctrl to crouch. The character (Zeus) has a very simple walking and crouching animation. The game houses 6 levels. In addition to the basic movements, the player can push boxes by walking into them (as seen in level 2) and also interact with circuits which turn hazards on and off (note that in level 5, the multiple circuit boxes can turn each other back on or off again) by standing in front of them and pressing "E" (as seen in levels 3, 4, and 5). Some hazards can't be turned off completely but are instead time-based, which allows the player to "jump" through them. Level 6 showcases the falling pipe mechanic. Here, if the player stands on the "broken" pipe for too long, both the player and the pipe will fall, resulting in the death of the player. Running into the yellow sparks will cause the player to die, as well. Falling off pipes will also cause the player to die. Each death type will result in the level restarting and the player death count (displayed in the top right corner) increasing. In some levels (4 and 5), the player must pick up a sunflower seed (the "key") by walking overtop it. After it has been picked up, it should be used to "unscrew" the screws on a vent (the "door") by pressing "E" while standing in front of it. This will result in the player going to the next level. For levels without the vent mechanic, the player simply has to follow the green wire off the screen which will trigger the next level to start.

A simple dialogue system was also added to explain the mechanics in game. :)

There is an end credit scene that the player has to watch (don't worry, it's really short!); but, at the end, two buttons will appear: one that allows the player to return to the main menu and one which allows the player to exit to desktop.
